Hi there! My name is Danny Berghoff. I am a geographer living in Annapolis, MD but I will always be a Buckeye at heart. I like using maps to discover new insights and "tell a story." I am especially interested in leveraging spatial data through web mapping tools. I aim to use this blog to document my GIS learning experiences with an emphasis on scripting, web mapping, and open source tools. When I am not mapping, I enjoy riding my bike, playing basketball and pickleball, and discovering new things to cook. Click here to view a story map of my GIS experience and education.

This website was created using Jekyll and the design is based on <a href="https://github.com/bogoli/-folio">this template</a> created by Lia Bogoev.
