Major League Baseball players face a grueling regular season schedule of 162 games packed into 6 months between April and September. Flying back and forth across the country is part of the sport, and a few bad road trips can make or break a season. With that in mind, my goal for this exercise was to visualize the win/loss performance throughout the 2015 season for my hometown team, Cincinnati Reds. I also wanted to try out some web-scraping using Beatiful Soup for Python.
